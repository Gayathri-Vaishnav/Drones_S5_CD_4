## 1. Abstract

Autonomous landing remains one of the most challenging phases of quadrotor UAV flight, particularly in GPS-denied environments such as indoor spaces, dense urban canyons, and forested or covered terrain, where satellite navigation becomes unreliable or entirely unavailable. This project presents an onboard, vision-based autonomous landing and dynamic tracking system for a quadrotor UAV that relies solely on a downward-facing monocular camera and multi-scale AprilTag fiducial markers for real-time relative pose estimation. Building on the foundational architecture proposed by Li et al. (2019), the system employs two coplanar AprilTags of different sizes to maintain accurate positioning across the full descent  from high altitude to touchdown  and a classical PID controller to convert position error into stable velocity commands.

The central contribution of this work is the replacement of the conventional rotation-matrix-based attitude representation with a **Unit Quaternion and Sandwich Operator** formulation, directly applying the quaternion theory covered in course 22AIE448. This substitution eliminates the risk of gimbal lock inherent to Euler-angle-based representations, provides a continuous and numerically stable method for transforming position vectors between the camera and body frames, and improves control smoothness during aggressive banking or turning maneuvers while tracking a moving platform. The resulting system is designed to achieve sub-1% landing error and robust tracking performance on both static and moving landing platforms, validating the practical benefit of quaternion-based attitude representation in a real-world robotics application.

## 2. Introduction

Autonomous landing is widely regarded as one of the most safety-critical and technically demanding phases of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operation, since even small errors in position or orientation during the final descent can result in a failed landing, damage to the vehicle, or harm to nearby people and property. While GPS-based navigation performs reliably in open outdoor environments, its accuracy degrades sharply or fails outright in scenarios common to real-world deployment  flight between tall buildings where signals are reflected and multipath errors accumulate, indoor operation where satellite visibility is entirely blocked, movement beneath tree canopies where foliage attenuates the signal, and other GPS-denied settings encountered in warehouses, disaster zones, or dense urban canyons. In these conditions, a quadrotor cannot depend on satellite positioning to execute a safe, precise landing, creating a clear and practical need for an alternative, self-contained sensing approach that does not rely on external infrastructure. Vision-based positioning offers exactly this kind of practical and low-cost solution: by mounting a downward-facing monocular camera on the UAV and placing known fiducial markers in this case, AprilTags on the landing platform, the drone can compute its relative position and orientation with respect to the target in real time, entirely onboard, using only the visual geometry of the tag as seen by the camera. This approach removes the dependency on GPS altogether while remaining computationally lightweight enough to run in real time on modest onboard hardware, making it well suited to small and medium-sized quadrotors with limited payload and processing capacity. Building on this idea, the present project takes as its architectural foundation the method proposed by Li et al. in "UAV Autonomous Landing Technology Based on AprilTags Vision Positioning Algorithm" (2019), which demonstrated a complete onboard pipeline for AprilTag-based autonomous landing using a dual-tag detection strategy  a large tag for reliable detection at high altitude and a small tag for precise positioning close to the ground combined with a classical PID velocity controller that converts the estimated position error into smooth, stable motor commands. This project adopts that pipeline as its starting point, reusing the camera-based tag detection stage, the dual-tag altitude-dependent switching logic, and the underlying PID control structure, while extending the attitude representation stage of the system with unit quaternions and the Sandwich Operator, as detailed in the sections that follow.

### 2.1 Our Contribution

The base paper represents drone orientation using a 3×3 **rotation matrix**, derived from sequential Euler-angle rotations. While functionally adequate under normal flight conditions, this representation is known to suffer from **gimbal lock**  a singularity that can cause a loss of one rotational degree of freedom during large-angle maneuvers and is computationally redundant compared to more compact alternatives.

In this project, we address this limitation by introducing **Unit Quaternions** and the **Sandwich Operator** to represent and transform orientation, replacing the rotation-matrix stage of the original pipeline. This is a direct, applied extension of the quaternion theory taught in course *22AIE448 – Introduction to Drones*, and forms the core technical contribution of this work. Specifically:

- The rotation matrix obtained from AprilTag pose estimation is converted into a unit quaternion, avoiding the singularities associated with Euler-angle representations.
- The Sandwich Operator is used to transform the tag's position vector from the camera frame into the drone's body frame in a numerically stable, continuous manner.
- This improves control smoothness and robustness, particularly during banking or turning maneuvers while tracking a moving landing platform.

By combining the proven vision-based landing architecture of the base paper with a quaternion-based attitude formulation, this project demonstrates a practical, singularity-free improvement to an established autonomous landing method.

### 3.2  Base paper math:

## Base Paper Equations (Li et al., 2019 — No Quaternions)

### 1. Pixel Conversion (Camera → Digital Image)

$$
u = \frac{x}{dx} + u_0 \qquad v = \frac{y}{dy} + v_0
$$

**In plain words:** A camera sensor sees the world as a continuous picture, but a computer stores it as a grid of pixels (like graph paper). This equation just says: "take the real position on the sensor and tell me which pixel box it lands in."

| Variable | What it is | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| `x, y` | Where a point actually is on the camera sensor (in millimeters) | This is the "real" physical location before we turn it into pixels |
| `dx, dy` | How big one pixel is (in millimeters) | Tells us how many pixels fit into one millimeter — this does the mm → pixel conversion |
| `u, v` | The pixel address of that point (column, row) | This is what the computer actually works with — an image is just numbers in a pixel grid |
| `u0, v0` | The pixel at the exact center of the image | Cameras don't always have their center at pixel (0,0), so we shift by this amount to correct for that |

---

### 2. One-Axis Rotation (Roll)

$$
R_x(\phi) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \cos\phi & -\sin\phi \\
0 & \sin\phi & \cos\phi
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**In plain words:** Imagine tilting a tray left-to-right — that's roll. This matrix is a "tilt calculator": give it an angle, and it tells you how every point on the tray moves.

| Variable | What it is | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| `φ` (phi) | The roll angle — how much the drone/tag is tilted sideways | Without this, we can't tell how the object rotated around one axis |
| `R_x(φ)` | The 3×3 matrix itself | A reusable "rotation machine" — multiply it with a point and it spins that point by angle φ |

---

### 3. Full 3D Rotation (Combining Roll, Pitch, Yaw)

$$
R = R_z(\psi)\, R_y(\theta)\, R_x(\phi)
$$

**In plain words:** A drone doesn't just tilt in one direction — it rolls, pitches (nose up/down), and yaws (spins left/right) all at once. Chaining three simple tilt calculators together gives the *full* rotation.

| Variable | What it is | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| `ψ` (psi) | Yaw angle — spinning left/right | Captures rotation around the vertical axis |
| `θ` (theta) | Pitch angle — nose up/down | Captures forward/backward tilt |
| `φ` (phi) | Roll angle — tilting side to side | Captures sideways tilt |
| `R` | The combined 3×3 rotation matrix | **This is the base paper's final answer for orientation** — no quaternion involved |

---

### 4. PID Controller (Turning Error into Speed Commands)

$$
V = K_p \cdot e \;+\; K_i \int e\, dt \;+\; K_d \cdot (e - e_{prev})
$$

**In plain words:** "How fast should the drone move to fix its position error?" It looks at three things — how far off you are *right now*, how far off you've *been* over time, and how *quickly* the error is changing — and blends all three into one speed command.

| Variable | What it is | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| `e` | The current position error (how far the drone is from where it should be) | The main signal — no error means no correction needed |
| `Kp · e` | Proportional term — reacts to the error right now | Bigger error → bigger push toward the target |
| `Ki ∫e dt` | Integral term — adds up all past error over time | Corrects small, persistent errors (like drift) that proportional alone can't fix |
| `Kd(e − e_prev)` | Derivative term — reacts to how fast the error is changing | Acts like a brake — stops overshoot and oscillation |
| `Kp, Ki, Kd` | Tuning knobs (gains) for each term | Control how aggressive or gentle each correction is |
| `V` | The final speed command sent to the drone | The actual output that moves the drone |

---

### 5. Position Error

$$
\text{Error} = \text{Desired Position} - \text{Current Position}
$$

**In plain words:** "Where you want to be" minus "where you actually are." That gap is what the PID controller above is trying to shrink to zero.

| Variable | What it is | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| Desired Position | Where the drone should be (usually right above the tag) | The target — set by the landing task |
| Current Position | Where the drone actually is, from AprilTag pose estimation | Our best real-time estimate of the truth |
| Error | The gap between the two | Drives the entire PID control loop |

---

## Our Contribution (Not in the Base Paper)

The base paper stops at equation 3 — a plain rotation matrix. **Everything below is our own addition**, applying quaternion theory from course 22AIE448.

## A. Turning the Rotation Matrix into a Quaternion

Given the Euler angles:

$$
\phi = \text{Roll}, \qquad \theta = \text{Pitch}, \qquad \psi = \text{Yaw}
$$

Define the sine and cosine of the half-angles:

$$
c_x = \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right), \qquad s_x = \sin\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)
$$

$$
c_y = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \qquad s_y = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
$$

$$
c_z = \cos\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right), \qquad s_z = \sin\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right)
$$

The quaternion is calculated as:

$$
q = w + xi + yj + zk
$$

where:

$$
w = c_x c_y c_z + s_x s_y s_z
$$

$$
x = s_x c_y c_z - c_x s_y s_z
$$

$$
y = c_x s_y c_z + s_x c_y s_z
$$

$$
z = c_x c_y s_z - s_x s_y c_z
$$

Therefore, the quaternion is:

**q = [w, x, y, z]ᵀ**

where:

- w = cₓ·c_y·c_z + sₓ·s_y·s_z
- x = sₓ·c_y·c_z − cₓ·s_y·s_z
- y = cₓ·s_y·c_z + sₓ·c_y·s_z
- z = cₓ·c_y·s_z − sₓ·s_y·c_z

| Variable | What it is | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| $r_{ij}$ | The element in row $i$, column $j$ of the rotation matrix $R$ | The raw ingredients — read directly from the rotation matrix |
| $q_0 \ (= w)$ | The "how much rotation" part of the quaternion (the scalar/real part) | Tells you the *size* (angle) of the rotation |
| $q_1, q_2, q_3 \ (= x, y, z)$ | The "which direction" part of the quaternion (a 3D vector) | Together with $q_0$, fully describes the same rotation — just more compactly than a 3×3 matrix |
### B. Rotating a Vector with a Quaternion (Sandwich Operator)

$$
L_q(v) = q\, v\, q^{*}
$$

**In plain words:** Think of `v` as a small arrow (like "the tag is 2 meters that way"). To rotate that arrow using a quaternion, you "sandwich" it — multiply the quaternion on one side and its conjugate on the other. What comes out is the same arrow, just rotated.

| Variable | What it is | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | The quaternion describing the rotation (from step A) | The "rotation instruction" |
| `q*` | The conjugate of `q` — `q` flipped/reversed | Needed to correctly complete the rotation and leave a clean result |
| `v` | The vector being rotated — here, the tag's position | We want the tag's position *relative to the drone*, not the camera |
| `L_q(v)` | The final, rotated vector | The tag's position now expressed in the drone's own frame of reference |

### 5.Methodology

## Methodology

Our implementation is a full physics-based simulation of the base paper's pipeline, built in MuJoCo, with three main modules working in a closed loop at each control step:

1. **Physics simulation (`envs/quad_env.py`)** — A high-fidelity MuJoCo model of a DJI M100-class quadrotor (3.5 kg) is stepped at 500 Hz internally (`DT_SIM = 0.002s`) and controlled at 50 Hz (`DT_CTRL = 0.02s`). It includes motor lag, ground-effect lift, and Dryden wind turbulence. The drone's true orientation is read directly from MuJoCo as a quaternion `[qw, qx, qy, qz]` and converted to Euler angles for the vision model.

2. **Vision simulation (`vision/camera_sim.py`, `vision/apriltag_detect.py`)** — A synthetic downward camera (640×480, FX=FY=650) renders the ground, landing pad, and a perspective-warped AprilTag (`tag36h11`) into an image, with Gaussian blur and pixel noise added for realism. The tag physically switches between a large (0.80 m) and small (0.20 m) marker at a 1.8 m altitude threshold. On the detection side, `pupil_apriltags` locates the tag in the image, and OpenCV's `solvePnP` recovers the tag's pose relative to the camera. The world-frame altitude and lateral offsets are then extracted using the world→body and body→camera rotation matrices, and smoothed with an exponential moving average (EMA) filter.

3. **Control (`control/pid_controller.py`)** — A finite-state controller (`SEARCH → APPROACH → DESCEND_HIGH → DESCEND_LOW → LAND`) selects a target descent speed for the current phase and feeds the lateral (X, Y) position errors into two independent PID loops. Vertical velocity is tracked with a proportional velocity loop. The resulting lateral/vertical accelerations are converted into thrust forces (with acceleration and thrust clipping for realism) and applied back into the MuJoCo physics step, closing the loop.

This differs from the base paper in two important ways: pose estimation uses OpenCV's iterative PnP solver instead of a closed-form rotation-matrix decomposition, and the controller is phase-aware (it changes behaviour by altitude/lock state) rather than a single flat PID loop — closer to how a real onboard autopilot would behave.
